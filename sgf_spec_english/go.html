<H1>Go (GM[1])</H1>


<H2><A NAME="types">Move, Point & Stone type</A></H2>

In Go the Stone becomes Point and<BR>
the Move and Point type are the same: two lowercase letters.
<P>
<IMG src="images/TA2.gif" ALT="[coordinates (TA2.gif)]">
Coordinate system for points and moves
<P>
The first letter designates the column (left to right), the second the row
(top to bottom). The upper left part of the board is used for smaller
boards, e.g. letters "a"-"m" for 13*13.<BR>
A pass move is shown as '[]' or alternatively as '[tt]' (only for
boards <= 19x19), i.e. applications should be able to deal with both
representations. '[tt]' is kept for compatibility with FF[3].<BR>
Using lowercase letters only the maximum board size is 26x26.
<P>
In FF[4] it is possible to specify board sizes upto 52x52.
In this case uppercase letters are used to represent points from 27-52,
i.e. 'a'=1 ... 'z'=26 , 'A'=27 ... 'Z'=52

<H3><A NAME="execute move">How to execute a move</A></H3>

When a B (resp. W) property is encountered, a stone of that color is placed
on the given position (no matter what was there before).<BR>
Then the application should check any W (resp. B) groups that are adjacent
to the stone just placed. If they have no liberties they should be
removed and the prisoner count increased accordingly.<BR>
Lastly, the B (resp. W) group that the newest stone belongs to should be
checked for liberties, and if it has no liberties, it should be removed
(suicide) and the prisoner count increased accordingly.
