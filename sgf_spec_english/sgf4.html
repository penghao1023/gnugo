<H1><A NAME="1">1. SGF basics</A></H1>

SGF is a text-only format (not a binary format).
<P>
It contains game trees, with all their nodes and properties, and
nothing more. Thus the file format reflects the regular internal structure
of a tree of property lists. There are no exceptions; if a game needs to
store some information on file with the document, a (game-specific)
property must be defined for that purpose.
<P>

<B>Node numbering:</B><BR>
When numbering nodes starting with zero is suggested. Nodes should be
numbered in the way they are stored in the file.<BR>
Example (of file above): root=0, a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6, g=7, 
h=8, i=9 and j=10.
<P>
SGF uses the US ASCII char-set for all its property identifiers and
property values, except SimpleText & Text.  For SimpleText & Text the
charset is defined using the <A HREF="properties.html#CA">CA</A> property.

<H1><A NAME="2">2. Basic (EBNF) Definition</A></H1>

The conventions of EBNF are discussed in literature, and on WWW in the
<A HREF="http://www.instantweb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?Backus-Naur+Form">Computing Dictionary</A>.
<BR>A quick summary:

<TABLE BORDER=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#efffff">

  "..." : terminal symbols
  [...] : option: occurs at most once
  {...} : repetition: any number of times, including zero
  (...) : grouping

</pre>
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>&nbsp;

  Collection = GameTree { GameTree }
  GameTree   = "(" Sequence { GameTree } ")"
  Sequence   = Node { Node }
  Node       = ";" { Property }

</TABLE><P>

White space (space, tab, carriage return, line feed, vertical tab and so on)
may appear anywhere between PropValues, Properties, Nodes, Sequences
and GameTrees.

There are two types of property lists: 'list of' and 'elist of'.
<TABLE BORDER=2><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#efefff">

<B>'list of':</B>    PropValue { PropValue }
<B>'elist of':</B>   ((PropValue { PropValue }) | None)

<H2><A NAME="2.2">2.2. Some remarks about properties</A></H2>

Property-identifiers are defined as keywords using only uppercase letters.
Currently there are no more than two uppercase letters per identifier.
<P>
The order of properties in a node is not fixed. It may change every time
the file is saved and may vary from application to application.
Furthermore applications should <B>not</B> rely on the order of property
values. The order of values might change as well.
<P>
Everybody is free to define additional, private properties, as long as they
do not interfere with the standard properties defined in this document.
<P>
Therefore, if one is writing a SGF reader, it is important to skip unknown
properties. An application should issue a warning message when skipping
unknown or faulty properties.
<P>
Only one of each property is allowed per node, e.g. one cannot have two
comments in one node:
<PRE>... ;  C[comment1]  B  [dg]  C[comment2] ; ...</PRE>
This is an error.
<P>
Each property has a property type. Property types place restrictions
on certain properties e.g. in which nodes they are allowed and with
which properties they may be combined.

<H3><A NAME="2.2.1">2.2.1. Property Types (currently five):</A></H3>

<PRE>
<B>move</B>	Properties of this type concentrate on the move made, not on
	the position arrived at by this move.
	Move properties must not be mixed with setup properties within
	the same node.
	Note: it's bad style to have move properties in root nodes.
	(it isn't forbidden though)

<B>setup</B>	Properties of this type concentrate on the current position.
	Setup properties must not be mixed with move properties within
	a node.

<B>root</B>	Root properties may only appear in root nodes. Root nodes are
	the first nodes of <A HREF="#ebnf-def">gametrees</A>, which are direct descendants from a
	<A HREF="#ebnf-def">collection</A> (i.e. not gametrees within other gametrees).
	They define some global 'attributes' such as board-size, kind
	of game, used file format etc.

<B>game-info</B>
	Game-info properties provide some information about the game
	played (e.g. who, where, when, what, result, rules, etc.).
	These properties are usually stored in root nodes.
	When merging a set of games into a single <A HREF="#ebnf-def">gametree</A>, game infos
	are stored at the nodes where a game first becomes distinguishable
	from all other games in the tree.

        A node containing game-info properties is called a game-info node.
        There may be only one game-info node on any path within the tree,
        i.e. if some game-info properties occur in one node there may not be
        any further game-info properties in following nodes:
        a) on the path from the root node to this node.
        b) in the subtree below this node.

<B>-</B>	no type. These properties have no special types and may appear
	anywhere in a <A HREF="#ebnf-def">collection</A>.
</PRE>

Because of the strict distinction between move and setup properties
nodes could also be divided into two classes: move-nodes and setup-nodes.
This is important for databases, converting to/from ISHI-format and
for some special applications.

<H3><A NAME="2.2.2">2.2.2. Property attributes (currently only one)</A></H3>

<PRE>
<B><A NAME="inherit">inherit</A></B>
	Properties having this attribute affect not only the node containing
	these properties but also ALL subsequent child nodes as well until
	a new setting is encountered or the setting gets cleared.
	I.e. once set all children (of this node) inherit the values of the
	'inherit' type properties.
	E.g. VW restricts the view not only of the current node, but
	of all successors nodes as well. Thus a VW at the beginning of a
	variation is valid for the whole variation tree.
	Inheritance stops, if either a new property is encountered and those
	values are inherited from now on, or the property value gets cleared,
	typically by an empty value, e.g. VW[].
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="2.2.3">2.2.3. How to handle unknown/faulty properties</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>Unknown properties and their values should be preserved.<BR>
If an application isn't able to preserve unknown properties, then it
has to display a warning message.
<LI>Illegally formatted game-info properties should be corrected if possible,
otherwise preserved.
<LI>Other illegally formatted properties should be corrected if possible,
otherwise deleted.<BR>
An application has to display a warning message, if it deletes illegally
formatted properties.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="2.2.4">2.2.4. Private Properties</A></H3>

Applications may define their own private properties. Some restrictions apply.
<P><B>Property identifier:</B> private properties <B>must not</B> use an
identifier used by one of the standard properties. You have to use a new
identifier instead. The identifier should consist of up to two uppercase
letters. SGF doesn't require to limit the identifier to two letters, but
some applications could break otherwise.
<P><B>Property value:</B> private properties may use one of the value types
defined in this document or define their own value type. When using
a private value type the application has to escape <B>every</B> <TT>"]"</TT>
with a leading <TT>"\"</TT>. Otherwise the file would become unparseable.
Should the value type be a combination of two simpler types then it's
suggested that your application uses the <B>Compose</B> type.

<H2><A NAME="double">3.1. Double</A></H2>

Double values are used for annotation properties. They are called Double
because the value is either simple or emphasized.
A value of '1' means 'normal'; '2' means that it is emphasized.
<BR>Example:
<BR>GB[1] could be displayed as: Good for black
<BR>GB[2] could be displayed as: Very good for black

<H2><A NAME="text">3.2. Text</A></H2>

Text is a formatted text. White spaces other than linebreaks
are converted to space (e.g. no tab, vertical tab, ..).
<P>
<B>Formatting</B>:<BR>
<I>Soft line break:</I> linebreaks preceded by a <TT>"\"</TT>
(soft linebreaks are converted to <TT>""</TT>, i.e. they are removed)<BR>
<I>Hard line breaks:</I> any other linebreaks encountered
<P>
<B>Attention</B>:
a single linebreak is represented differently on different systems, e.g.
<TT>"LFCR"</TT> for DOS, <TT>"LF"</TT> on Unix.
An application should be able to deal with following linebreaks:
LF, CR, LFCR, CRLF.<BR>
<P>
Applications must be able to handle Texts of any size.
The text should be displayed the way it is, though long lines may be
word-wrapped, if they don't fit the display.
<P>
<B>Escaping:</B> <TT>"\"</TT> is the escape character. Any char following
<TT>"\"</TT> is inserted verbatim (exception: whitespaces still have to
be converted to space!).
Following chars have to be escaped, when used in Text: <TT>"]"</TT>,
<TT>"\"</TT> and <TT>":"</TT> (only if used in compose data type).

<H3>3.2.1. Example:</H3>

<PRE>
C[Meijin NR: yeah, k4 is won\
derful
sweat NR: thank you! :\)
dada NR: yup. I like this move too. It's a move only to be expected from a pro. I really like it :)
jansteen 4d: Can anyone\
 explain [me\] k4?]</PRE>
could be rendered as:
<PRE>
Meijin NR: yeah, k4 is wonderful
sweat NR: thank you! :)
dada NR: yup. I like this move too. It's a move only to be expected
from a pro. I really like it :)
jansteen 4d: Can anyone explain [me] k4?</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="simpletext">3.3. SimpleText</A></H2>

SimpleText is a simple string. Whitespaces other than space must be
converted to space, i.e. there's no newline! Applications must be able
to handle SimpleTexts of any size.
<P>
<B>Formatting</B>: linebreaks preceded by a <TT>"\"</TT> are converted to
<TT>""</TT>, i.e. they are removed (same as Text type). All other linebreaks
are converted to space (no newline on display!!).
<P>
<B>Escaping</B> (same as Text type): <TT>"\"</TT> is the escape
character. Any char following
<TT>"\"</TT> is inserted verbatim (exception: whitespaces still have to be
converted to space!). Following chars have to be escaped, when used in
SimpleText: <TT>"]"</TT>, <TT>"\"</TT> and <TT>":"</TT>
(only if used in compose data type).


<H2><A NAME="stone">3.4. Stone</A></H2>

This type is used to specify the point and the piece that should be placed at
that point. If a game doesn't have a distinguishable set of pieces (figures)
like e.g. Go (GM[1]) the Stone type is reduced to the Point type below, e.g.
"list of stone" becomes "list of point" for that game.
<BR><B>Note:</B> if a property allows "list of stone" a reduction to
"list of point" allows compressed point lists.

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="3.5.1">3.5.1. Compressed point lists</A></H3>

The PropValue type <I>"list of point"</I> or <I>"elist of point"</I>
may be compressed.<BR>
Compressing is done by specifying rectangles instead of listing
every single point in the rectangle. Rectangles are specified by using the
upper left and lower right corner of the rectangle.
<PRE>
<B>Definition:</B>
<I>List of point</I>: list of (point | composition of point ":" point)
For the composed type the first point specifies the upper left corner,
the second point the lower right corner of the rectangle.
1x1 Rectangles are illegal - they've to be listed as single point.
</PRE>
The definition of 'point list' allows both single point [xy] and rectangle
[ul:lr] specifiers in any order and combination. However the points have
to be unique, i.e. overlap and duplication are forbidden.
