<H2><A NAME="types">Point and Move types</A></H2>

<H3>Point</H3>
A board position is specified by one letter and one number, letters are always
displayed left-to-right across the screen. Numbers are normally displayed
1-n from bottom to top of the screen.
<BR>Examples: [a5], [C8], [d4]

<H3>Move</H3>
For normal moves specify the source and destination squares, as specified by
point type. The two points may be seperated by either '-' or ':'
(to identify a capturing move) and may be followed by a trailing
commentary such as '+' and '!'.
Applications don't need to interpret or preserve these move annotations - 
they are optional and intended for human readability.
<P>
The following unusual moves specifiers are also used when appropriate
<UL>
<LI>'Pass'
<LI>'Resign'
<LI>'Forfeit'
<LI>'Escape' - used only in Gemma variation
</UL>

Examples: B[e1-e3];W[C2:C5++];W[c5-c6];B[resign]
