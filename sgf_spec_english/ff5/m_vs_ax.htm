<H1>`Move' vs. `Add Stones'</H1>

SGF provides two ways to add new stones to the board: 
<UL>
<LI>make a move 
<LI>add a stone 
</UL>

We are going to have a closer look at both and explain the definition
using examples.

<h2>How to execute `Add Stone'</h2>
From the specification:
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ffe8d8><TT>
Add (resp. clear) black/white stones to the board. This can be used
to set up positions or problems. Adding (resp. clearing) is done by
'overwriting' the given point with black/white/empty stones. It
doesn't matter what was there before. Adding a stone must not
trigger any rule specific actions, e.g. in Go GM[1]: no prisoners
nor any other captures (e.g. suicide). Thus it's possible to create
illegal board positions.
</TT></TABLE>
<P>
Note: Illegal positions remain on the board. I.e. when stepping to the
next node breathless stones remain on the board. Unless, of course, they
get captured by an adjacent move, or overwritten by another `Add Stone'
command.
<P>
If your application can't handle illegal positions (e.g. a computer player
or scoring algorithm) then it should
display a message to the user. The message could state, that from now on
(due to the illegal position) certain features (e.g. scoring) are no longer
available. Or it could state, that it had to stop at the node before.
Your application <B>must not</B> remove breathless stones automatically.

<h2>How to execute a move</H2>

From the specification for GO GM[1] (The different steps are numbered):
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ffe8d8>
<TT>
<B>How to execute a move</B>
<OL>
<LI>When a B (resp. W) property is encountered, a stone of that
   color is placed on the given position (no matter what was there
   before).
<LI>Then the application should check any W (resp. B) groups that are
   adjacent to the stone just placed. If they have no liberties they
   should be removed and the prisoner count increased accordingly.
<LI>Then, the B (resp. W) group that the played stone belongs to
   should be checked for liberties, and if it has no liberties, it
   should be removed (suicide) and the prisoner count increased
   accordingly. 
<LI>Lastely, the move number should be increased by one.
</OL></TT></TABLE>
<P>
Ad 2): Only adjacent points are checked. Other breathless stones are
<B>not</B> removed.

<TR><TD COLSPAN=4>
Note: In the above examples only empty points were overwritten in phase one.
As the specification says, the point gets overwritten, no matter what was
there before. Therefore, the following initial positions would have <B>exactly
the same</B> outcome.
