<h2><A NAME="types">Point, Stone, and Move types</A></h2>

<h3>Point and Stone</h3>
<img src="TA2.gif">

<p> Point and Stone are the same.  Gess uses the same coordinate system
as Go GM[1], two lowercase letters.  The first letter is the horizontal
dimension; the second is the vertical.

<p> The "edges" of the Gess board are placed so that one row/column of
points lays outside each edge.  The default board size is 20x20 (18x18
inside the "edges").

<h3>Move</h3>

<p> A move is a pair of points, which are the centers of the "from"
point, a colon ":", and the "to" point of the 3x3 piece being moved.
It is illegal for either of these points to be on the parimeter
(outside the "edge").

<p> Viewers are responsible for checking the colour of the stones in
the 3x3 region at the "from" point.  All stones must be the same colour,
that of the player making the move.  Otherwise, the move is illegal.
