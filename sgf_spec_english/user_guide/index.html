<H1><A NAME="what">1. What is SGF?</A></H1>

SGF is short for <B>Smart Game Format</B>.
<P>
SGF is a file format used to store game records of two player board games.
It is a text-only tree based format, i.e. it doesn't contain binary
data and thus can easily be emailed or posted to newsgroups.
Tree based means, that starting from a root one can follow a main path
or switch to variations (or variations of variations).
<P>
SGF provides many features such as board markup, comments, game information,
setup positions etc. In order to create a good SGF file one should
have some knowledge of the internal structure of SGF.

<H2>Versions</H2>
SGF was invented by Anders Kierulf in 1987 and became more and more popular.
Since then SGF has undergone 2 major revisions.
<UL>
<LI><B>FF[1]</B> is the original specification by Anders Kierulf. This 
specification is the core of all later versions. Some
applications still use this dated version of SGF - e.g. MGT (MS-DOS version) 
which had become quite popular before Windows became en vogue.
<LI><B>FF[3]</B> was written by Martin M&uuml;ller in 1993 and was a first 
step towards a clean specification of the SGF standard. By then SGF was 
an accepted standard for Go games on the Internet. FF[3] defined a lot
of new properties, e.g. many game information properties and some
markup properties.
<LI><B>FF[4]</B> was written by Arno Hollosi in 1997 with help from many
SGF applications programmers. FF[4] carried on the spirit of FF[3] and
provides a clean, unambiguous definition of SGF. New features such as 
arrows, lines, boards of any size and rectangular boards have been 
introduced. However as this standard is very young, it isn't widely 
adopted. This will (hopefully) change in the future.
</UL>
<h2>What does an SGF file look like?</h2>

<H2>SGF applications</H2>
SGF applications are available for all platforms. Most of them are freeware,
some are shareware. Have a look at the
<A HREF="ftp://igs.nuri.net/Go/">Go FTP Archive</A>.
<P>
As no program is perfect and SGF is evolving it's strongly recommended
to update one's favorite SGF application at least once a year.
Right now many people still use applications that are over five years old
which causes a lot of trouble.
<P>
<BIG><B>Update your application on a regular basis!</B></BIG>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#toc">back to top</A>
<HR noshade>

<H1><A NAME="general">2. General Concepts</A></H1>

SGF consists of nodes which are structured in a tree, i.e. a node has
exactly one predecessor called parent, but may have one <I>or more</I>
successors called children. Thus SGF can store game records (a list of moves)
and variations of the actual line of play.
<P>
<B>A node is the smallest unit visible to the user</B>,
i.e. the user steps through
the tree node-wise (forward [down the tree], backward [up the tree], etc.).
<P>
<B>A node consists of properties.</B> These properties contain a certain kind
of information, e.g. the <I>B[]</I> property describes a black move made,
the <I>C[]</I> property contains a comment text (don't worry: you don't
have to remember the property names :-).
<P>
For example: if you step forward and see a new move on the board and a
comment in the comment window plus some markup on the board then all this
information is represented by <B>different</B> properties which are parts
of the <B>same</B> node.
<P>
Thus editing is done in two levels: adding/deleting nodes and adding
or deleting properties.<BR>
To make it clear: a move is part of a node and not the node part of the
move. A move is represented by <I>one</I> property but a node may contain
<I>more than one</I> property.

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#toc">back to top</A>
<HR noshade>

<H1><A NAME="move_vs_place">3. `Make a Move' vs. `Place a Stone'</A></H1>

SGF provides two ways to add new stones to the board:
<UL>
<LI>make a move
<LI>place a stone
</UL>

<B>Making a move</B> is like making a move in a real game,
i.e. you can only make
moves on empty intersections, you can only make one move per turn
(here: per node) and you may take some prisoners by making a move.
In most applications the current move is highlighted.
<P>
<B>Placing a stone</B> on the board is like setting up a position, e.g.
handicap stones, setting up a problem or analysis of positions ("this
would work if the position over there would look like this...").
Thus one can place <I>more than one</I> stone, stones of different colors,
remove stones, replace stones with that of the opposite color
all in <I>one</I> node.<BR>
But: there are no prisoners made as these are not regular moves!

<H2>Restrictions</H2>

It is good style (and is required since FF[4]) to
distinguish between a move and the position arrived at by this move.
<P>
Therefore it's <B>illegal</B> to mix setup properties and move
properties within the same node.
<P>
<B>Move properties</B> are properties such as a black or white move, 
annotations on a move (bad move, interesting move, etc.) or how
much time a player had left after the current move was made.<BR>
<B>Setup properties</B> are properties used to set up or describe a position
such as place black/white stones on the board or who's turn it is to play.
<P>
A <A HREF="../proplist_t.html">detailed list</A> of setup and move
properties is available.
<P>
Unfortunately many applications allow mixing setup and move properties, so
it's up to the user to create a good SGF file.


<P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#toc">back to top</A>
<HR noshade>

<H1><A NAME="style">4. Style</A></H1>

<UL>
<LI>The <B>first</B> branch (variation `A' or `1') is the <B>main</B> branch.
<BR>Variation `A' should always follow the real game.
Consider yourself viewing a game where you have to press `b' then `c'
and then `b' again just to follow the real game - disturbing.<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>Don't imitate sibling-style variations. Use a sibling-style application
instead. Have a look at <A HREF="#variations">definition and reason</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>Omit extra pass plays and empty nodes at the end of the game.<BR>
The last node of the game should contain the last move on the board.
Do not put game information such as `Black wins and connects Ko' into
the comment field, rather add another move to the game which connects
the Ko.<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>Never substitute moves with placing stones.<BR>
Never substitute a regular move with placing (setting up) a stone.
Some applications
rely on regular moves for sophisticated functions. Furthermore applications
that show the position of the next move can't display the position of the
setup stone.
Have a look at the <A HREF="#move_vs_place">difference</A> between a real
move and setting up a stone.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>Length of labels<BR>
Since FF[4] it's possible to use labels of any size. But some (old)
applications have problems displaying labels longer than 2 chars.
Use long labels with care!<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>Don't store game information such as who's black/white etc. into
the first comment - use game information properties instead.
Here's the <A HREF="#why_gameinfo">reason</A> why.
<BR>&nbsp;

<LI>Use annotations for standard situations (e.g bad move).<BR>
Annotations are represented by extra SGF-properties and thus can be
treated in a <A HREF="#annotations">special way</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;
</UL>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#toc">back to top</A>
<HR noshade>

<H1><A NAME="variations">5. Variations</A></H1>

<IMG SRC="VARI.GIF" ALT="[ Variation tree ]" ALIGN=RIGHT>
SGF allows you to store variations of the main path of play, which
is useful for analyzing different lines of play. The picture to the right
illustrates this concept.
Variations are usually assigned letters starting with 'A' where 'A' is
the continuation of the current line of play. That's why some applications
refer to the next move as 'A'.
<P>
Applications show variations as either siblings or children.
<B>Showing variations as children</B> means,
that if the applications is currently at move #3 (like in the
picture) it provides you the choice of 'A' through 'C' which are all move #4.
That is, by selecting a variation, you step forward in the tree.
<P>
<B>Showing variations as siblings</B> means,
that the application provides the variation choice
at move #4. In this case, selecting a variation selects between moves at the
same tree level (here: #4 moves). This method is perceived as alternatives to
the current move and by e.g. selecting variation 'B' move #4 'A' is removed
from the board and move #4 'B' is shown.
<P>
The differences between this two styles may cause confusion when the variations
 are accompanied by comments.
For example, imagine the comment saying something like: "This is bad. See
variation 'B' instead." If the author used a children-style application this
comment is stored together with move #3. If readers use a sibling-style
application, they see the comment on move #3, but no variations: they appear
with the next move. The other case (author: sibling style, reader: children
style) has similar implications. Users who read the comment at move #4 have
to go back one move and select the variation there.
<P>
Most people prefer the sibling style as it seems more natural. They even 
imitate the sibling style in children-style applications. This is done
by removing the previous move and making a new move in the same (first) node
of the variation. This is <B>bad style</B>. Since FF[4] it's illegal
syntax too. If you have a look at the picture you see that all alternative
moves are at the same level (that is, all #4's are in one column, all #7's are
in one column). By imitating the sibling-style in chlidren-style applications
this is no longer the case, as the #4 moves of variation 'B' and 'C' would
appear under move #5 of variation 'A'. Furthermore those
files cannot be converted to other fileformats easily. If you like sibling-style
variations then use a sibling-style application!

<H1><A NAME="markup">6. Board markup</A></H1>

SGF provides a wide selection of board markup. Almost every markup
you see in magazines or books is available in SGF too. However some
applications are not able to handle certain types of markup. 
Here's a short list of markup types available:<BR>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#toc">back to top</A>
<HR noshade>

<H1><A NAME="annotations">7. Comments and annotations</A></H1>

In order to comment on a move or position SGF allows to store text
in each node, which usually gets displayed in the comment window of your
SGF application. Text is easy to edit, but has some disadvantages too:
<UL><LI>language - if you don't understand the language you can't
understand the comment
<LI>applications can't use the text to provide more sophisticated
functions (such as searching for bad moves or tesujis)
<LI>computer players can't utilize the text information
</UL>

Therefore SGF provides a set of so-called annotation properties. These
properties are encoded differently in the file. They are not stored as
readable text, but as tokens, which have a special meaning. Thus the
SGF application reading the file knows their meaning and can provide
the following:
<UL><LI>multi-lingual support - the application displays the message
in the selected language.
<LI>search or other database functions
<LI>computer players can use annotations in their fuseki- or joseki-library
to determine the best move or good alternatives.
</UL>

There are three types of annotation properties: <I>general annotations</I>,
<I>move annotations</I> and <I>annotations on positions</I>. Have a look
at the following table:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5 >
<TR><TH>Annotation<TH>Property<TH>Type<TH>may be emphasized?<TH>Meaning

<TR><TD>White to play<TD>PL<TD>Position<TD>no<TD>It's white turn to play
</TABLE>
<P>
Unfortunately not many applications support these properties yet. This will
hopefully change in the future. Consider using annotation properties
whenever possible. They have many advantages despite their simplicity.

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="#toc">back to top</A><HR noshade>

<H1><A NAME="gameinfo">8. Game Information</A></H1>

SGF provides a wide range of properties to store so called game information.
Usually applications provide a dialog or extra window to type in game
information.
<P>
Note that some entries have a <B>mandatory format</B>. Why?<BR>
Because standard compliant entries can easily be parsed by applications 
and therefore can be searched in game collections or displayed in your 
favorite (customized) scheme. Unfortunately many applications allow the 
user to enter illegal information - so it's up to you to create correct 
entries - please take care!
<P>
E.g. consider that you've got a game collection of about 5000 pro games
and want to look for games played by Cho Chikun in March 1996.
Now if dates are stored as e.g. DT[5th March 1996], DT[11/3/96], DT[1996/3/7],
DT[1996 6 8] - do you really know which of these games were played in March?
<P>

<H2><A NAME="why_gameinfo">Why should you use game information?</A></H2>
Sometimes you see a SGF file which has all the information stored into
the first comment.<BR>This is bad style!<BR>
If the information is stored into a comment it's almost impossible for a
computer program to find the relevant data - searching becomes impossible.
Therefore store the game information at the proper place - it'll save
you much time in the future and makes your database more usable.
It makes converting or interchanging of games much more easier too.

<H2>List of game information properties</H2>
Here's a complete list with a short description of each item.
If this list doesn't answer all your questions have a look at the
<A HREF="../properties.html#AN">official, detailed specification</A>.
